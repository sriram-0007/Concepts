            Three types of data representation
            1.Ungrouped T1   2,14,17
            2.Grouped with singe class value  T2    2*10,5*15,7*20    this is ele*frequency like 2*10 means 2 appears 10 times
            3.Grouped with range class value  T3    (11-20)*10,(21-30)*15,(31-40)*7 this is values between 11-20 appears 10 times;



            1.Average=x1+x2+x3+....+xn/n  is central value;
            2.Mode= element that occured most no of times;
            3.Median=can eliminate outlier if n is odd (n+1)/2 is the Median
                    in case of n is even then (n/2 +n/2+1)/2  data shoud be sorted before finding median;

            4.Dispersion or Scatterness


                

            5.finding averae for T3
                (0-9)*2,(10-19)*10,(20-29)*12,(30-39)*8
                to calculate average of this we take average of range of class value 
                eg:(0-9)=>(0+9)/2=4.5 now the data chages to T2 4.5*2
                do the same for remainig value and calculate average x1*f1+x2*f2+...+xn*fn/(f1+f2+...+fn);
            6.What is cumulative frequency? it is just prefix sum of frequency;
            7.Calculating median in T3 data
                to calculate median in T3 data find cumulative frequency and then do n/2 is n is even or n+1/2 if n is odd then find the class value range in which this
                value lies  (currCalssCumulativefreq-prevCummulativefreq)/(freqency of curr class)* difference of class range+ low value of class range

            8.claculating mode for T3 class is class lowerlimit+(modeclass-prevfreq)/[(modeclass-prevfreq)*(modeclass-nextfreq)]*lengthofclass;
